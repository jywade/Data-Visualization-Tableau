# Flights-Analysis
Tableau Data Dashboard

By leveraging Tableau, I crafted compelling visualizations that not only narrate a captivating story but also shed light on hidden patterns within the data. The dataset I worked with encompassed information on flights, airlines, and airports, which required merging three distinct Excel files into a cohesive tableau project. Through exploration of the data, I successfully addressed three key questions, unraveling valuable insights.

Q1: What is the average distance of flights for each airline? Which airline has the highest average flight 
distance?

Summary: In this visualization we see that the airline Virgin America (VX) had highest average flight 
distance amongst the 14 total airlines, with an average flight distance of 1,419 miles. Additionally, as 
seen in the tooltip, VX also has the highest average airtime (184 min.) with United Air Lines closely 
following at 165 minutes. At the bottom of both averages is American Eagle (MQ) with an avg distance of 
423 and airtime of 67.

Q2: Which state(s) experienced the highest number of weather delays and flight cancellations, and how 
does it compare to other states? Is there a correlation between the frequency of weather delays and 
cancellations in different states?

Summary: As seen in the visuals, Texas (TX) comes in first in terms of weather delays and flight 
cancellation frequency. The scatter plot reveals a clear positive correlation between weather delays and 
cancellations. As weather delays increase, so do the number of flight cancellations. This finding suggests 
that adverse weather conditions significantly impact flight operations, leading to a higher likelihood of 
cancellations. Both weather delays and flight cancellations appear to be most frequent in the time of 
February, right before spring.

Q3: Which factor or reason caused the highest number of cancellations in 2015? How does each reason 
vary throughout the year?

Summary: The pie chart reveals that the most common cause of cancellation in 2015 was due to adverse 
weather. Notably, February experienced the highest number of weather-related cancellations, while 
September witnessed the lowest. Additionally, cancellations attributed to the National Air System were 
most prevalent during February, while Airline/Carrier-related cancellations peaked during the summer 
months from June to September, surpassing both weather and National Air System-related reasons with 
a significant count of 491.
